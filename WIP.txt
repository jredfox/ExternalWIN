- DirSafe.exe fix *. not displaying files with no extension (also if file doesn't have extension for dir file path add a dot to the end)
- DirSafe.exe add illegal ending wildcards of " " or "."
- Option for All offline files O|M|Q when enabled(additional search to WDI and dropping reparsepoints of main search)
