DirSafe.exe
- Recursion safe directory walker
- Dynamic & Static Exclusions
- Attribute Filter
- Reparse Point Filter (Junction / Mount Point, Symlink, Symlinkd)
- Multi Directory seperated by ;
- WildCards seperated by | (support wildcard file names, wildcard blacklist directory and file names)

TODO:
- Attributes Advanced filter with OOP objects format:[SHA|OM-I--D] -Means not for that attr comparison --Means globally not.
- Attribute filter don't consider onedrive files as reparsepoints
- RP Filter Advanced allow ; as sep per statement, | as statement seperator and - as a prefix not for that statement. -- for globally not
- RP Filter Advanced example:0x80000021; -0x80000021 | 0x80000021 --0x80000021
- Wildcards

Printing options
N = Normal(DEFAULT) <type> C:\path <target>
B = Bare C:\path
P = Parsible everyting <type> <path> <target>

Missing featues With no plan on adding:
- Sort Order(useful but not for ExternalWIN)
- Timestamps(useful but not for ExternalWIN)
- Non positional parameters(/A etc...)
- 8dot names
- File Ownership(unkown format unlike icalics command)
- Random junk that shouldn't be there as it's useless like pause after each dir, /4 when the years are already 4 digets, wide list both varients etc...

Changes/Improvements:
- Safe Recursion on memory when walking through recursively of dirs
- Safe Recursion that specifically avoids ReparsePoints that are not onedrive's
- Parsible format for easy parsings
- Multiple wildcards per directory entry
- Directory entries are in argument one seperated by ";"
- More Attributes like M or E to work with
- Attribute filter allows for OR statements optimizing the time needed so you don't have to run the command multiple times for just comparing attributes
- L for Reparsepoints only does reparse point links(onedrive files don't count)
- Reparse filter that allows you to filter all reparsepoint files of a certain reparse point id like symlinks or junctions
- Dynamic Exclusions sep ";" (From command line argument 6) and Static(Configureable) exclusions from the config generated right next to it
