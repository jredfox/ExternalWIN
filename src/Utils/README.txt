DO NOT RUN THESE SCRIPTS UNLESS YOU KNOW WHAT YOU ARE DOING!!!!

WIM-Extract.bat will do what it says but if your entire OS was in the WIM file you will have trouble deleting the files inside unless you extracted them to a VDISK
REG-Backup.bat backups your current registry
REG-APPLY.bat needs to be run in WinPE (Windows Installation Media) Booted from USB or it will fail on at least some accounts that are Windows Protected
