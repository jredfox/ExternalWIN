DO NOT RUN THESE SCRIPTS UNLESS YOU KNOW WHAT YOU ARE DOING!!!!

WIM-Extract.bat will do what it says but if your entire OS was in the WIM file you will have trouble deleting the files inside unless you extracted them to a VDISK
forcedelete.bat will delete all files after taking ownership. This is dangerous if you don't know what you are deleting
