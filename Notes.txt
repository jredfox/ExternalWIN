- How to Install Windows more then 2x On MBR LEGACY Disk
  1. Run WinInstallVHDX.bat or if you have a VHD Already WinInstallVHDX-Custom.bat
  2. You can Erase the disk if you wanted to clean install it but if your simply installing another windows say no

  4. If you already have a VDISKs partition or 4 partitions say NO to create VDISKS partition otherwise say YES

- How to Repair boot
##################################
NOTE: This will replace the current boot loader with the targeted windows. 
For example if you run WinRepairBoot.bat for windows 7 and you want the nicer windows 10-11 menu you would have to run 
WinRepairBoot.bat again and specify the partition with windows 10 or 11 on it to get the nicer Menu
##################################
  1. Decide whether or not you want to Re-Image the Boot (deletes all data and replaces it with the boot.wim backup) If you want to Re-Image the boot go to "How to Re-Image the boot Drive"
  2. Run WinRepairBoot.bat . This will add a boot entry to the current menu. If you wanted to clean all boot entries before running it please format the partition as FAT32 first unless your repairing your current boot
     then please Delete any unwanted boot entries instead

- How to Re-Image the Boot Drive

__________________________

NOTES
__________________

- You MUST RUN these scripts on WINDOWS 10 and above Even if your installing something older then Windows 10. The commands for DISM and others didn't exist or didn't contain all the options required. 
- If you don't have a windows 10 Installed run these scripts in Windows 10 Installation Media (WinPE) USB.
- You Must have Unallocated space in order to install Windows on any disk If your not Erasing it. It will not shrink or overwrite a partition in order to make space for the installation
- Factory Reset(Recovery Partition) Doesn't work for MBR LEGACY Disks on an External Hard Drive or USB but will work on an Internal Hard drive.
- You cannot capture an internal hard drive as a WIM and install it to an External hard drive (May be able to by messing with the registry but I haven't been able to get it to work)
- Windows 7 and below cannot be installed to an external harddrive without generic Intel or AMD USB 3.0 or above drivers. It will crash even in safemode
- Windows 7 Even if installed on an externally will always have the Internal Disk Access because the San Policy value of 4 didn't exist in windows 7 and below
- Windows 8-8.1 cannot be installed to a USB flash drive(crashes) but can be installed to an external Harddrive
- Windows 11 CAN be installed on an MBR LEGACY Disk without a TPM or Secure Boot being enabled (unsupported hardware). As my install doesn't check for these things
- Windows XP & Vista are untested. XP doesn't have a WIM file so unless you can install it to a fresh drive and Capture it as a WIM before booting it you couldn't install it anyways
- File Explorer (Windows Explorer Now) Popups when Partitioning the harddrive cannot fully be disabled. Please close any "You Need To Format" Popups
- IMG2WIM.bat cannot run in WinPE and has to be run on regular windows because it uses Powershell which isn't enabled in WinPE unless you manually added it yourself
- ESD2WIM.bat can run in WinPE unlike IMG2WIM but it can only convert .ESD --> .WIM

FAQ:
__________________________
1. Q: How to Select Windows Install.esd or Install.wim ?
- mount ISO either by right clicking and mount or double clicking and opening it
- find the sources folder go inside
- find install.esd or install.wim
- SHIFT+RIGHT CLICK --> Copy As Path
2. Q: I ran Your WinInstall.bat or a different Script and now when I Plugin a USB / External Harddrive It doesn't pop open or autorun. The program it must be a virus?
   A: This is not a virus I simply disable popups of file explorer during the installation process. If it's still disabled after installing
or you closed the script before it's done you will have to run FileExplorerPopUp-Enable.bat which will restore the default file explorer popup settings.
You can also run any main script that format or partitions the hard drive and before you put in any info it Re-Enables it during the cleanup. You can close out when you see a prompt asking for information
