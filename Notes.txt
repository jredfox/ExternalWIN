- How to Install Windows Clean (Erase Drive)
  1. Run WinInstall.bat and when Prompted say yes to Erase the drive

- How to Install Windows Multi Boot Menu
  1. Start WinInstall.bat
  2. Say no to Erase
  3. Say yes to Merge

- How to Install Windows Multi Boot Without Menu
  1. Start WinInstall.bat
  2. Say no to Erase
  3. Say no to merge
  4. To swap to a different windows click F+2 or F+12 during boot and you have to manually swap each time.
     The purpose of Installing Dual Boot windows without the menu is so you don't have to select the windows every time saving boot time and your sanity

- How to Install Windows more then 2x On MBR LEGACY Disk
  1. Run WinInstallVHDX.bat or if you have a VHD Already WinInstallVHDX-Custom.bat
  2. You can Erase the disk if you wanted to clean install it but if your simply installing another windows say no
  3. Say No to create System Boot Partition if you have already installed windows at least once on the disk
  4. If you already have a VDISKs partition or 4 partitions say NO to create VDISKS partition otherwise say YES
  5. You can repeat these steps merging as many VDISK windows installations as you want merging the same VDISKs partition. The reason is because VDISKS are installed to a file on a partition and not a partition itself

- How to Delete a boot entry
  1. Run BootEntry-Delete.bat

- How to Repair boot
##################################
NOTE: This will replace the current boot loader with the targeted windows. 
For example if you run WinRepairBoot.bat for windows 7 and you want the nicer windows 10-11 menu you would have to run 
WinRepairBoot.bat again and specify the partition with windows 10 or 11 on it to get the nicer Menu
##################################
  1. Decide whether or not you want to Re-Image the Boot (deletes all data and replaces it with the boot.wim backup) If you want to Re-Image the boot go to "How to Re-Image the boot Drive"
  2. Run WinRepairBoot.bat . This will add a boot entry to the current menu. If you wanted to clean all boot entries before running it please format the partition as FAT32 first unless your repairing your current boot
     then please Delete any unwanted boot entries instead

- How to Run WinRepairBoot.bat in WinPE (Installation Media)
  1. Run WinRepairBoot.bat
  2. If Prompted To input Your System Partition Input X drive as WinPE is X drive for X:\Windows*

- How to Re-Image the Boot Drive
  1. Run WIMApply-Universal.bat with the boot.wim file found in C:\ExternalWin\backups\boot.wim or in your recovery partition R:\ExternalWin\backups\boot.wim (use openrecovery.bat to access)

- How to backup current Registry
  1. Run REG-Backup.bat

- How to restore changes to a Registry (DOESN't Delete new Entries)
  1. Run REG-ApplyBackup.bat

- How To create a Registry Image:
  1. Run Reg-GenHiveList.bat on your current windows
  2. Boot into WinPE --> Shift+F10
  3. Run RegIMG-Backup.bat

- How to Apply a Registry Image:
##################################
WARNING: If the Registry Image isn't recent all wanted changes to the registry will be deleted. Please Use .REG Files and run REG-ApplyBackup.bat after Re-Imaging the Registry
Re-Imaging the registry will delete any malware edits to the registry or unintended changes without needing to re-install windows all over again
##################################
  1. Create .REG backups using REG-Backup.bat
  2. Place your latest stable .REG backup files into the scripts directory
  3. Boot into WinPE --> SHIFT+F10
  4. Run RegIMG-Apply.bat
  5. Run Windows normally 
  6. Run REG-ApplyBackup.bat
  7. Boot windows normally

- How to Re-Assign A Recovery Partition after a fresh re-install
  1. Run WIM-Apply-Universal.bat with the R for recovery option to reflash the default recovery partition with your cached OEM recovery partition (saves drivers, software and default apps)
  2. Boot onto the same machine you want to assign the recovery partition to. ReAgentc.exe ignores the /target flags for enabling or disabling an offline windows installation meaning it may fail
  3. Run WinRecoveryAssign.bat

- How to Get A Recovery Partition working on a USB FlashDrive
  1. Boot onto the USB Flash Drive after you have installed it with a recovery partition
  2. Run WinAssignRecovery.bat


##################################
What is WIM Images and How do I Use them? WIM images are a windows image backup normally of an entire partition such as the c drive or boot drive. 
You can backup both your partitions on windows and re-apply them later
##################################
 
- Capturing a WIM Image
  1. Boot into WinPE! Capturing on Different Drive from current boot while windows is running causes security errors when re-applying the WIM image on AMD and other devices
  2. If the Partition is special such as a boot or recovery partition Run OpenPar.bat
  2. Run WIM-Capture-WINPE.bat or WIM-Capture.bat with the second option allowing allowing for a full path backup not just the entire drive
  3. If the Partition is special such as a boot or recovery partition Run CloseBoot.bat for boot or CloseRecovery.bat for recovery

- Applying the WIM Image
  1. Boot into WinPE unless the partition is not currently booted (Not the Current Boot or C Drive)
  2. Run WIMApply-Universal.bat

- Converting from VHD(X) ISO or ESD to WIM
  1. Run IMG2WIM.bat

- How To Mount WIM Image
  1. Download and install 7-ZIP
  2. Right click on the WIM Image --> 7-ZIP --> Open Archive
  3. Using DISM to mount the WIM image is so much worse and takes too much writing time please use 7-ZIP Instead

- How to Get Data From an Incremental WIM Image Backup
  1. Download and install 7-ZIP
  2. Right click on the WIM Image --> 7-ZIP --> Open Archive
  3. Go to the index you need and find the correct data

- How to Change Name / Description of a WIM Index
  1. Simple Answer is you don't they removed this feature when moving from IMAGEX to DISM
  2. Long Answer is third party software that may not support max (default) compression level and may risk WIM Image corruption.
     While 7-ZIP does support WIM editing, Editing the [1].xml doesn't work and the xml only exists when there are multiple indexes
  3. The Longest Answer: you can export the image using DISM /export-image using /description:"New Description" /name:"New Name" but merging the indexes will simply append it. You would have to export all the indexes to the new WIM image to rebuild it in order of the original indexes and replace the new name / description at the index that you modified

- How To Stop Format MSGs From File Explorer when plugging in a USB Drive
  1. Run CleanupPar.bat . The script is safe and does not try to dismount DVD/CD Drives and Shouldn't Dismount BLUERAY (Untested)
__________________________

NOTES
__________________

- You MUST RUN these scripts on WINDOWS 10 and above Even if your installing something older then Windows 10. The commands for DISM and others didn't exist or didn't contain all the options required. 
- If you don't have a windows 10 Installed run these scripts in Windows 10 Installation Media (WinPE) USB.
- You Must have Unallocated space in order to install Windows on any disk If your not Erasing it. It will not shrink or overwrite a partition in order to make space for the installation
- Factory Reset(Recovery Partition) Doesn't work for MBR LEGACY Disks on an External Hard Drive or USB but will work on an Internal Hard drive.
- You cannot capture an internal hard drive as a WIM and install it to an External hard drive (May be able to by messing with the registry but I haven't been able to get it to work)
- Windows 7 and below cannot be installed to an external harddrive without generic Intel or AMD USB 3.0 or above drivers. It will crash even in safemode
- Windows 7 Even if installed on an externally will always have the Internal Disk Access because the San Policy value of 4 didn't exist in windows 7 and below
- Windows 8-8.1 cannot be installed to a USB flash drive(crashes) but can be installed to an external Harddrive
- Windows 11 CAN be installed on an MBR LEGACY Disk without a TPM or Secure Boot being enabled (unsupported hardware). As my install doesn't check for these things
- Windows XP & Vista are untested. XP doesn't have a WIM file so unless you can install it to a fresh drive and Capture it as a WIM before booting it you couldn't install it anyways
- File Explorer (Windows Explorer Now) Popups when Partitioning the harddrive cannot fully be disabled. Please close any "You Need To Format" Popups
- IMG2WIM.bat cannot run in WinPE and has to be run on regular windows because it uses Powershell which isn't enabled in WinPE unless you manually added it yourself
- ESD2WIM.bat can run in WinPE unlike IMG2WIM but it can only convert .ESD --> .WIM
- Windows USB Flash Drive Doesn't Fully install the Recovery Partition due to a bug with REAGENTC not looking at the /target flag. You have to Boot into the OS on the USB and Run WinAssignRecovery.bat

FAQ:
__________________________
1. Q: How to Select Windows Install.esd or Install.wim ?
- mount ISO either by right clicking and mount or double clicking and opening it
- find the sources folder go inside
- find install.esd or install.wim
- SHIFT+RIGHT CLICK --> Copy As Path
2. Q: I ran Your WinInstall.bat or a different Script and now when I Plugin a USB / External Harddrive It doesn't pop open or autorun. The program it must be a virus?
   A: This is not a virus I simply disable popups of file explorer during the installation process. Run FileExplorerPopUp-Enable.bat as admin If popups are still disabled after installation or if you closed before the script was complete
You can also run any main script that format or partitions the hard drive and before you put in any info it Re-Enables it during the cleanup. You can close out when you see a prompt asking for information
3. Q: I ran WinInstall.bat or another ExternalWIN scripts and Now Format Popups / Security Popups Don't happen and File Explorer Closes????
   A: Run FileExplorerPopUp-Enable.bat it will re-enable all autoruns and kill any FENDx86.exe instances running
4. Known Non Fixable Issues
  - WinAssignRecovery.bat may not work on an offline windows version and should only ever be called from the current boot this is due to REAGENTC ignoring the /target for /enable or /disable I also tried the /OSGUID and that didn't work either
  - IMG2WIM.bat will not work in WinPE due to the fact that powershell doesn't exist in WinPE
  - Can't Rename WIM Images Name or Description Without Recapture and or WIM Rebuild
  - Can't set Recovery Partition path on USB Flash Drive on when using WinInstall.bat. This is a bug of REAGENTC assuming the computer is your computer and ignores the target value. It doesn't know the target was windows go nor does it care it ignores everything
5. Q:DISM Error When Applying Custom Captured WIM Image
   A:This occurs When a security descriptor on the captured drive is invalid. Please Capture all WIM images in WinPE(Installation Media) USB to avoid this
6. Q:Help I Captured the WIM Image in WinPE(USB) and I am still getting the security error when Applying the WIM image to an External Hard drive / USB
   A:You should add the errored directories into the removeatt.cfg file located in your current ExternalWIN installation. 
   - Go to C:\Windows\Logs\DISM\dism.log
   - Scroll to the end and then search up for a Security Error / Fail
   - Add the Directory into ExternalWIN\removeatt.cfg
   - Re-Capture the WIM in WinPE
   - Re-Apply the WIM on the new index
   - If the error goes away and looks like it came with the computer please create a new issue called "dir cfg" to github.com/jredfox/ExternalWIN/issues
7. Q:Help File Explorer Popups are still happening during the Installation Process
   A:Older Computers need a higher sleep time change SleepDisable to 2500 and SleepEnable to 5500 and if it still doesn't work set them both to 0 and set RestartExplorer to true
